The Branding Bible Framework is an easy to use system for generating an online Brand Bible. Designers create the content and add visual assets through the Markdown Extra syntax and interact with the style through easily understandable JSON objects.

Instructions will be added to this document as the project nears completion.

A distribution liscence will be added to this project as it nears completion.

This project is being developed by the Suits & Sandals, LLC. Director of Technology, Zachary Brady, in collaboration with the Creative Director, Miles Roxas, for use internally but will be open source from the begining. If interested in the project please contact Zack at zachary@sasbranding.com to learn more about it.

In the meantime have fun watch this slowly come together.
